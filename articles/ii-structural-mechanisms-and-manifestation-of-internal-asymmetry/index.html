                        <h2>II. Structural Mechanisms and Manifestation of Internal Asymmetry</h2>
                        <p>The theoretical framework established in the preceding section finds its practical expression in concrete organizational and technological structures that either exacerbate or alleviate information imbalances.</p>
                        
                        <h3>2.1. Data Silos: The Primary Generator of Enterprise Information Asymmetry</h3>
                        <p>Data silos represent the physical and cultural manifestation of organizational IA. These structures arise when departments optimize their operations using isolated computer systems, leading to a functional disconnect. The persistence of a "silo mentality" actively obstructs the ability of the firm to execute data-driven decisions effectively.</p>
                        
                        <p>The empirically confirmed necessity of breaking this silo mentality is particularly acute regarding the intersection of Information Technology (IT) and marketing functions, where cooperation is essential for improved strategy. Research indicates that cross-functional cooperation enhances data exchange, facilitates the integration of new ideas, and enables the creation of new marketing tools, thereby improving overall decision-making.</p>
                        
                        <p>A notable finding related to silo mitigation concerns the differing impact of functional expertise. While marketing business knowledge does not always translate into a direct, positive effect on data-driven decision-making, <strong>IT business knowledge</strong> demonstrates a strong, direct, positive effect. This suggests that understanding the architecture, accessibility, and structure of the underlying data‚Äîknowledge typically possessed by the IT function‚Äîis often more critical for overcoming entrenched silos than possessing functional business knowledge alone.</p>
                        
                        <p>The existence of internal data silos creates a profound internal resource imbalance, where data is concentrated and hoarded rather than shared. This condition structurally impedes cross-functional collaboration required for modern corporate value co-creation. Value co-creation requires resource balance; silos intentionally create imbalance by concentrating data resources. Consequently, internal silos are inherently anti-cooperative, making sophisticated data-driven strategies, such as the comprehensive implementation of Customer Experience Strategy (CXS) reliant on cross-functional inputs, inherently difficult to execute successfully.</p>

                        <h3>2.2. Information Power Dynamics and Potential for Internal Dataveillance</h3>
                        <p>The resource imbalance associated with IA fundamentally raises questions about who controls the balance of power and value co-creating interactions within the enterprise. When the firm centralizes and controls the resources necessary for producing value (i.e., data access, analytical tools, and interpretation), the interaction between management and departments becomes inherently unequal.</p>
                        
                        <p>The emergence of Big Data has enabled enterprises to engage in practices known as dataveillance‚Äîthe systematic capacity to capture, profile, and store detailed insights around patterns of individual consumption norms. While typically discussed in the context of consumer-firm relationships, the centralization of enterprise data via integrated systems (ERP and sophisticated BI) grants the principal (management) the ability to engage in comprehensive internal dataveillance. Management can track and profile employee activity, monitor productivity, and assess internal resource utilization, often without the full awareness or transparent consent of the agents contributing the data.</p>
                        
                        <p>The implication of this centralization is that the locus of vulnerability shifts. While Big Data strategies traditionally heighten concern for <em>consumer</em> vulnerability, the internal application of these technologies shifts this vulnerability onto the <em>employee or agent</em>. The power imbalance resulting from centralized systems risks disempowering the user who contributes towards the data-driven insights. Unchecked monitoring capabilities, while useful for resolving Moral Hazard (tracking hidden actions), introduce a new ethical IA concerning transparency and fairness. The ethical concerns raised by external AI/Big Data‚Äîdata privacy, transparency, and bias‚Äîapply equally internally. The firm has an ethical obligation to ensure that the information harnessed is utilized in a "free and fair manner" without disadvantaging the very agent who contributed the data or intellectual capital. This requires careful policy to manage the ethical IA frontier.</p>

                        <h3>2.3. The Role of Management Accounting in Resolving Agent IA</h3>
                        <p>Management accounting systems play a crucial role in formally attempting to resolve internal IA by providing structured, objective information for decision-making and control. These systems utilize contract design, monitoring mechanisms, and regular reporting to improve information flow and align incentives, serving as a direct countermeasure to the Principal-Agent problem.</p>
                        
                        <p>Conceptual research has proposed sophisticated models to address the problem of IA in management accounting, particularly focusing on situations involving the non-negotiating behavior of transacting internal parties (principal and agent). One such model is based on the <strong>dictator game</strong>. This game-theoretic approach incorporates several key variables into the analysis:</p>
                        
                        <ol>
                            <li>The price elasticity of accounting information.</li>
                            <li>The quantum (volume and availability) of available accounting information.</li>
                            <li>The expected utility level achieved by the principal and the agent.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p>The goal of this modeling approach is to derive an optimal negotiating behavior that results in the systematic reduction of the prevailing IA.</p>
                        
                        <p>The conceptualization of the "quantum of available accounting information" provides strong analytical justification for investment in data quality and governance. Improving the reliability and comprehensiveness of this quantum directly enhances the utility achieved by the principal. This validates the strategic importance of Data Governance: ensuring high-quality, reliable data input is essential for the management accounting function to achieve the optimal negotiating behavior necessary for internal IA resolution.</p>
